Creating input files
====================

The uncompressed files were originally exported from GIMP and then hand-edited
to have different formats or channel masks, and to some a DXT10 header was
added.

The compressed files were converted from source PNGs in `BasisImporter/Test`
using [AMD Compressonator](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/compressonator).
Run the `convert.sh` script.
