[configuration]
# Enable to assume that the file is written in a Y up orientation. If empty,
# the orientation is read from metadata in the file header, and if not
# present it's assumed to be Y down. Images are then flipped on import to
# have Y up, or a warning is printed in case it's not possible. Basis doesn't
# support 3D textures, only 2D arrays and cubemaps, so Z orientation never
# needs to be adjusted.
assumeYUp=

# No format is specified by default and you have to choose one either by
# changing this value or by loading the plugin under an alias. Should be one
# of Etc1RGB, Etc2RGBA, EacR, EacRG, Bc1RGB, Bc3RGBA, Bc4R, Bc5RG, Bc7RGBA,
# PvrtcRGB4bpp, PvrtcRGBA4bpp or RGBA8. If not set, falls back to RGBA8 with
# a warning. Not used for transcoding HDR images, set formatHdr for those.
format=
# Same as format, but for HDR images. Should be one of Bc6hRGB, Astc4x4RGBAF,
# RGB16F or RGBA16F. If not set, falls back to RGBA16F with a warning.
